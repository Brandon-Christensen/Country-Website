            Vatican City doesn't have a national animal

        <p>
            Something interesting about Vatican City is that
            <br>
            it doesn't have a national animal. This 
            <br>
            is because Vatican City doesn't have any domesticated animals, at all.
            <br>
            So. it is one of the few, if not the only one without a national animal.
